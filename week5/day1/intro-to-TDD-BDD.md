# Intro to BDD/TDD

SoftDevLifeCyc main cycle phases:
    - Design 
    - Development
    - Delivery


BDD (Behavior Driven Development) is mainly used for the Design Phase

# BDD
    - Developing from the perspective of the user
    - Takes into account entire user experience/expectations
    - All aspects of application must be designed through this use lens
        - User Interface (UI)
        - API (how user will interact with software being created)
        - Server choices

# End to End Tasks
E2E are the end-goal of behavior driven development: these tests simulate interactions with your application to determine whether the application as a whole is working correctly or not.

# TDD
    - TDD (Test Driven Development) is focused on the initial setup of an application
    - Development needs to be guided by tests to help with setting guardrails against scope creep
        - Scope creep is when new and unecessary features are added to an application
